## Anatomy

Each widget has a title bar and a content section. The title bar is standard for all widgets, but the content section varies depending on the widget type.

#### Title

Identifies the widget. Max characters: 23 (includes spaces)

#### Title link

Links users to a more complete view of information summarized in the widget. The title link should be as specific as possible (i.e. "view resources" not "view all"). Max characters: 15

#### Call to action

Provides the user with a quick action. This element is optional and can incorporate a "plus" icon if appropriate. Max characters: 23

### Core widget

Core widgets are designed by the dashboard team, and are displayed on the dashboard by default. They usually display platform functionality, such as maintenance events or support cases.

### Service widget

Service widgets are designed by service teams, and must be actively added to the dashboard using the customize dashboard feature. Services wishing to propose a widget should follow the widget review process (see Widget approval).
