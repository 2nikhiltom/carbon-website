## Low impact

As removing does not destroy an asset, user confirmation is not required.

## High impact

- Require user confirmation

- Text should tell the user the consequences of the removal and that the action cannot be undone.

- Optionally, when the remove button is selected it changes to show ‘Removing...’.
