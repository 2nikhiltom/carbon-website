Creation is the generation of a new resource. This pattern is distinct from adding, which is the movement of an existing resource.

## Standard creation

\*\* The standard creation pattern is used when no stepped guidance is needed and the input fields are directly related to each other. Include anchor links here

### Modal

If there are only one or two decisions to be made during a creation, use a small, standard modal overlaying the content where the creation was initiated. Avoid scrolling inside a small modal.

### Side panel

If you have limited screen real estate, consider using a side panel. Side panels also keep the user aware of the context in which they were working. You may choose to use either the slide in or slide over panels.

### Full page

If your creation flow consists of multiple fields and/or supporting imagery, consider the full-page option. Full-page creation flows allow you to take advantage of maximum screen real estate.

## Multistep creation

If the creation task is complex, consider breaking the process up into multiple steps. Display related or dependant options together.

Multistep creation follows the same principles as Standard creation, with the addition of multisteps.

### Confirmation

When any create action is a success, a notification banner can be presented to visually confirm this.

## Anatomy

### Button position

When the full-page dialog is viewed in mobile, the buttons are positioned at the bottom of the screen.

<Caption>Example of advanced option.</Caption>

On a larger screen, it is recommended that buttons always remain visible to the user.

If a display is likely to extend beyond the visible display, buttons should be located in the top right and should stick upon scrolling. If only a few buttons are present, they can be placed on the left below the last field.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

</Column>
</Row>

### Illustration/Image

To include a supporting image, place it on the right-hand side of the window.

### Advanced option

The advanced option is used to avoid overwhelming users while still allowing advanced users to access everything. It can be applied to the side panel and the full-page dialog.

Have a minimal set of options visible by default, with the ability for the user to choose if they want to expose more ‘advanced’ options. If the user switches to advanced mode, remember this next time they perform the same task.
