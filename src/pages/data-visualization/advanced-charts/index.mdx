title: Advanced charts

<PageDescription>

Advanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets. While less intuitive than basic charts, the visualizations should still tell a story the user can understand.

Note: The advanced charts are not included in the Carbon Charts repostitory yet, as they are either still in design phase or awaiting code contribution. To see our roadmap, request missing guidance, or contribute your own content, please go to carbon-charts [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts).

## Alluvial diagram

Alluvial diagrams are a type of flow diagram originally developed to represent changes in network structure over time.

## Heatmap

A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

## Tree diagram

A Tree Diagram is a way of visually representing hierarchy in a tree-like structure.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

## Geography with overlays

### Choropleth map

A map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

</Row>

### Proportional symbol

Symobls driven by data are overlayed on geographical region. A common symbol used is bubble with the area of the circle proportional to its value in the dataset.

<Row>
<Column  colLg={8} colMd={6} colSm={4} >

### Connecting lines

Connection Maps are drawn by connecting points placed on a map by straight or curved lines.

While Connection Maps are great for showing connections and relationships geographically, they can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links. Connection Maps can also be useful in revealing spatial patterns through the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are on a map.
