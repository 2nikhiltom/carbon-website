### Elements constructing the charts are designed to work together, each playing a different role in data communication.

## Anatomy of charts

### Rectangular charts

Most charts fall into this category, with two dimensions represented on a vertical and a horizontal axis. Rectangular charts typically are constructed with these common elements.

#### Chart title

The title of a piece of visualization should be descriptive and qualitative, when possible, communicate the insight revealed by the data below it.

#### Legend 

Legends are the labeled marks that assists readers to interprete data. Read more about legends here.

#### Axes

Axis labels should be written — Read more about axis usage.

#### Tooltip

By default, tooltip hows on hover to any data point to reveal it in a more easily readable format. Content on the tooltip should repeat the corresponding values of the data point on both axes, and more details if available. Read more about tooltip usage.

#### Graph frame

This is the area where the data will be visualized as graphics or numbers. Grid lines, when strategically used, could help with visually estimate the data value, but this is not required. In fact, too much grid lines makes the graph frame busy, and worsen the data interpretation experience.

### Circular charts

Charts using this layout and elements are primarily the pie and donut charts. Other circular layout charts include Radar and Solar charts.

#### Label

A percentage value of the individual category count over the total.

#### Big number

A number with a single word description. Examples include “15,250 Browsers”, “\$1.3M Revenue”, or “Total 450”. A big number here may be used to display total sum or individual count of the slice upon interaction. This is component also can be used independently on a dashboard, see Big number.
