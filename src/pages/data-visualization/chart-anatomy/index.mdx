## Anatomy of charts

### Rectangular charts

Most data visualizations are rectangular charts, with two dimensions represented on a vertical and a horizontal axis. Rectangular charts are typically constructed with a set of common elements including a legend, axis titles, and navigation tools like a zoom bar and tooltip.

#### Chart title

The title of a visualization should be concise and descriptive, and should reflect the insight the data reveals.

#### Legend

Many charts will use different visual properties such as colors, textures and shapes to represent different categories or dimensions of data. A legend tells you what these associations mean and helps you to determine the chart's meaning. [Read more on legend usage.](../legends)

#### Axes

The X axis is horizontal and the Y axis is vertical. Axes should be accessible against their background with a 3:1 contrast ratio. [Read more on axes usage.](../axis-and-labels)

#### Tooltip

A tooltip is a message that appears when a cursor is positioned over an element, such as a data point, icon button, or truncated text. By default, tooltips show on hover to reveal more detailed information or context for specific chart elements. A tooltip should repeat the corresponding values of the data point on both axes and any other relevant details. [Read more about tooltip usage.](../tooltips)

#### Graph frame

The graph frame is the area where data will be visualized with graphics or numbers. Grid lines help a viewer estimate the values of a data point but are not required. Use grid lines sparingly, as too much visual noise makes the graph frame busy and negatively impacts the user's ability to interpret the data.

### Circular charts

Circular charts are primarily pie and donut charts. Other circular layout charts include radar and solar charts.

</Row>

#### Label

A label offers the percentage value of the whole for an individual category.

#### Big number

A chart's big number is a number with a single word description. Examples include “15,250 browsers”, “\$1.3M revenue”, or “Total 450”. A big number here may be used to display a total sum or the individual count of a slice upon interaction. This element can also be used independently on a dashboard. See [big number]().
