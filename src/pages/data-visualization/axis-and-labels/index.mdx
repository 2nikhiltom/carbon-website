<PageDescription>

Legends summarize the distinguishing visual properties such as colors or texture used in the visualization. A legend or key helps the user build the necessary associations to make sense of the chart.

## Starting at zero

#### When starting at non-zero is bad

Always start numerical axis at zero for part-to-whole and comparisons charts, such as bar and area chart. Truncated Y axis can distortion the perception, making a small difference look big and significant.

#### When starting at non-zero is good

Line charts and scatter plots are less sensitive to this distortion because they are intended to communicate trends and not relative size of the difference. In these cases, cropping the Y axis help users to better identify the direction of change.
